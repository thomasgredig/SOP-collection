The computer control does not sense the objective position and could ram the z-stage into the objective. Protect the lock mechanism of the focus. Before the AFM head is mounted or unmounted from the Z stage, the ON/OFF switch for the laser beam must be turned off. Otherwise, the laser beam diode in the AFM head may be damaged. When the AFM head is mounted or unmounted from the Z stage, ensure that the AFM head does not sustain any damage, and that it is properly grounded. The AFM head is extremely sensitive to electrostatic discharge. The superluminescent photodiode is 830nm, infrared, so invisible. If you lose the photodiode position, it is difficult to find the spot, since the wavelength is mostly infrared. Adjust the x-y position of the photodiode only in small increments. 2.2 System Start-Up Carefully review all warnings attached to the side of the AFM box. Sign-in to the logbook and read previous status. Turn on the computer. Turn on the Park XE AFM Controller. See image below. v AFM controller 2.3 Sample Preparation Use a magnetic sample holder disc and mount your sample to it using double-sided carbon tape. NOTE: You should touch your glove to the tape to reduce the stickiness of the surface allowing you to remove the sample without issue later. Open the AFM isolation chamber and place the holder onto the sample stage. WARNING: The sample stage is magnetic. You should approach the stage with the holder from the side and slide it into place. Approaching from above the stage will cause the magnetic forces to “grab” the holder, crashing it into the surface, which can cause damage to the piezo-electric xy stage. Turn on the Activation Table by pressing the power button on the right-side of the table. You should see the table front panel light up when it is on. See image below. Set the Activation Table’s mode to ACTIVE by pressing the state button on the left-side of the table. The LED should change from “LOCK” to “ACT”. See image below. Activation Table 2.4 Engaging Sample Launch the Smart Scan program and wait for the initialization process to finish. Adjust the focus of the objective lens so it is focused on the cantilever. See image below. To adjust the focus of the objective lens you must to hold the focus wheel and unlock it by moving the lever on the wheel back. It can be lowered by turning the wheel counter-clockwise. WARNING: ALWAYS unlock the focus wheel, before moving it, and then hold the focus wheel when making adjustments as it will freely fall under the weight of the objective lens. Failing to unlock, may break the objective mechanism and hold the wheel as it will move under gravity. You can determine when the cantilever is in focus by viewing the computer screen as you lower the objective. Once the cantilever is in focus, lock the focus wheel by moving to lock lever toward you. Do not over-tighten the lever but ensure it is a good position by making sure the objective maintains focus after it has been locked and you are no longer holding the wheel. It is a common issue that the objective motional stage breaks, if not properly used. Optics The photodiode is 830nm, so infrared and therefore invisible. It is hard to locate the photodiode light beam, once you lose The photodiode beam can be seen in the software by looking at the cantilever. There will be a bright spot when the beam is on the cantilever. You can move the position of the beam by adjusting the dials on top of the z-stage. See image below. The beam should be positioned near the tip of the cantilever. Adjust the position of the beam until the “Intensity (A+B)” reading is maximized (approx. 3 V) The detector position is visualized in the software as a crosshair with a red/green dot with readings of the vertical/lateral position of the detector. It needs to be aligned so the dot in the crosshair is green. Adjust the position of the detector by adjusting the dials on the front of the z-stage. See image below. By turning the dials on the front of the z-stage the dot on the crosshair will move left/right and up/down. Adjust the position of the detector until the “Vertical (A-B)” and “Lateral (C-D)” readings are minimized (less than 0.100 V is ideal) Photodiode and Detector Adjustments In the “Smart Scan” software click on the “Auto” tab in the top-right. Make sure that the green light for the centered diode beam is ON, then select the “Position” icon on the left-side of the screen. (If the LED is red, you need to align the photodiode beam first.) This will begin the process of measuring the cantilever’s resonant frequency. The resonance frequency and Q-factor must be recorded in the logbook. The AFM will then begin to approach the sample so the tip is engaged with the surface of the sample. Wait for this process to complete before proceeding. (It may take a minute or so.) Once the auto-engage process is finished, adjust the focus of the objective so it is focused on the sample’s surface. The cantilever should be close to the surface now. Close and lock the door so noise vibrations do not interfere with imaging. 2.5 Non-Contact Mode Imaging Ensure Non-Contact Mode NCM is set for the scan. This is done by selecting NCM from the Head mode list next to the “Setup” tab in the SmartScan software. See image below. Non contact mode imaging WARNING: If you need to move to a different area of your sample for a scan see the “Lift Procedure” section for instructions. Attempting to move the sample without following the lift procedure will break the cantilever. You can capture an image by selecting the “Image” icon on the left-side of the screen. Adjust the parameters for your scan as needed and determine an appropriate location for files to be saved once the scan is complete. Once the scan is complete, you can redefine a new area by adjusting the scan window in the application or defining new scan area parameters. NOTE: Your scan area should be a power of 2 and must be square. Ex: 128 x 128, 256 x 256, 512 x 512, etc. Scan areas “snap” to a grid defined by the software when moving them. You can make fine adjustments to the scan area window by using the “Offset” parameter. You can use Park XEI software to analyze your images on Windows systems. Gwyddion can be used for Mac OS systems. 2.6 Lift Procedure To move to a different area of your sample you need to “lift” the tip away from the surface sufficiently far enough above the surface so the cantilever easily clears the height of all features on your sample. Defining the distance the tip should be raised and clicking the “Lift” button will disengage the tip from the sample’s surface. Lifting in intervals of 50 um is typically fine. CAUTION: The objective is very close to the z-stage during scanning. Using a large value for the lift may cause the z-stage to crash into the objective lens, damaging it. A lift of 100 um is usually fine but make sure you are aware of your sample’s expected feature height to determine an appropriate lift height above the surface. If there is any doubt, it is best to first move the objective up by unlocking the focus wheel and turning it clockwise (away from you) to prevent the z-stage from crashing into the objective. Refocus on the sample once the lift is complete. Moving the sample can be done by adjusting the dials on the sample stage. They will move the stage forward/back and left/right. See image below. AFM controller After repositioning your sample, click on the “Auto” tab and select the “Position” icon to re-engage the tip to the sample’s surface. This will perform a new scan of the cantilever to determine the resonant frequency and intensity which should be recorded in the logbook. Scanning can be performed following instructions in the “Imaging the Sample” section above. 2.7 Finishing Measurements Unlock the objective (push lever back), then move the objective to the top position and lock back (pull forward). Perform a lift from the surface to disengage the tip. Typically a lift of 100 um is sufficient to clear all features. Click the “End” icon on the left-side of the screen to automatically raise the z-stage away from the sample. A manual lift can be performed but it is best to select the “Lift z all” option to provide the largest clearance between the z-stage and sample, allowing for easier loading/unloading of samples. Remove the sample holder from the sample stage by sliding it horizontally across the surface until it is no longer held by the magnet. Return the Activation Table to the “Lock” state by pressing the button on the front left-side of the table, wait until it is locked, will take about 30 seconds, ONLY THEN turn it off by pressing the button on the front right-side. If the setup is used again, the next day, the activation table can be left on in the locked position. 2.8 Cantilever Replacement IMPORTANT: Turn OFF the photodiode. Ensure the objective is in its highest position. Ensure all LEDs are off, ONLY THEN disconnect the cable on the left-side of the z-stage and move the paddles securing it to the instrument to the “in” position. The paddles are located at the top of the z-stage mounting rails. See image below. AFM controller The z-stage is heavy. Carefully slide the z-stage to the right, avoiding the objective, until it is off the mounting rails. See image above. Place it in the stand as shown in the image below. AFM controller The cantilever can be removed by carefully lifting it up off of the two pins holding it in place. Place the removed cantilever in the appropriate slot of the replacements case. Remove a new cantilever from the case, record the new cantilever’s ID in the log book, and attach it to the z-stage by aligning the pins to the cantilever’s slots. You will need to carefully attach it onto the z-stage until it softly clicks into place. See images below. CAUTION: The cantilever is extremely delicate. Avoid getting the tip to touch any surface or anything. AFM controller Slide the z-stage back into its place on the instrument, careful to avoid hitting the objective. Slide it all the way to the left, until it cannot be moved anymore. Lock the z-stage in place by moving the paddles to the “out” position. Connect the cable to the left side of the z-stage. Focus on the cantilever tip and adjust laser according to previous section.

Open the vales on both tanks and confirm that the tanks are not empty. The regulated pressure on each tank should read between 10 psi. Make sure that the vacuum pump is properly attached to the sputter system unit and turned on. Put on gloves before touching anything inside the sputter deposition chamber. Open the top of the EMS575X unit and ensure that the appropriate targets are mounted. If not, unscrew the four screws holding the target mount and insert the desired target, taking note of which position it is in (the left side is target A, the right side is target B). When changing or moving targets, label which target is in which position on the paper mounted on the wall above the unit. Targets are stored in the drawer labeled Sputter Coater Components, directly beneath the sputter unit. For more information regarding target insertion/removal, see the EMS575X instruction manual. Confirm that the sample plate is covered with Al foil. The foil can be replaced if it contains significant amounts of deposited materials. Place the samples on the center of the sample plate, with shadow masks if desired. Turn on the unit using the black power switch on the back right hand side of the unit. Remove the FTM (film thickness monitor) cover. This is the circular metal cap that covers the FTM. Close the top of the unit. Using the buttons on the front of the unit, cycle through the options until the desired settings are reached. When the settings are correct, press the start button. The screen will display the important final settings once more. If the settings are correct, press the start button again. If at anytime during the sputtering process a problem occurs, the system can be stopped manually by pressing the stop button on the front panel. During the target cleaning sequence and the sputter coating sequences, the cylindrical metal valve on the back left side of the unit can be used to adjust the Argon pressure inside the unit. Carefully adjust this valve during the deposition until the plasma (the purple glow inside the chamber) reaches the greatest intensity. This will improve the deposition rate. The deposition occurs in coating sequences of 5 minutes each (to prevent overheating). After the desired thickness has been reached, the system will end the sequence and the chamber will be vented. When the screen indicates that the venting process has terminated, open the top of the system and remove the samples. Replace the FTM cover and close the unit. Close the valves to the Nitrogen and Argon tanks, and turn off the pump. Leave the unit on until the top metal lid of the unit has cooled to room temperature. After cooling, turn the unit off using the power switch.

AC mode operating screen. In the “Engage Panel” click “Initialize Motors” and wait for that to finish. 6.5.2 Loading Samples Open door on AFM and remove magnetic shield. Raise the black lever on the right side and pull out the stage. Make sure that sample is free of all debris. Insert sample into the AFM stage. The sample should lay atop a metal sample plate. If the sample is not fragile and not more experimentation is going to be performed on the sample, it can be secured to the sample plate using double sided carbon tape located in the red tool cabinet. NOTE: some adhesive should be removed from the tape by repeatedly touching the surface of the tape with a glove or kim wipe. If the sample is fragile or more experimentation will be done to the sample, inserting a sample plate into the AFM stage and placing the sample on top of it will suffice. WARNING: the AFM stage is magnetic and the internal electronics are sensitive to shocks. When loading sample plates slide them in from the side. DO NOT DROP THE PLATE IN FROM ABOVE WHEN LOADING. Push the stage back into place and move the black lever down. Place magnetic shield and close AFM door. 6.5.3 Setting the Focuses on the Tip and Sample Using the knob on the AFM, turn CCW until the tip is about ’‘’1 mm’’’ from the sample. Tip lowering knob on Cypher AFM. Turn Clockwise to raise the tip and turn counter-clockwise to lower the tip. NOTE the tip will travel faster depending on how much the knob is turned. In the “Video” window, use the arrows that surround a red target to move the laser until the cantilever is in view. Note This step might take a while if the size of cantilever that is being used greatly differs from the last one. It is helpful to adjust the brightness and exposure to do this. The settings I used were: Brightness: ~11%, Exposure: 33. If the video window is not displaying anything, try zooming in and then out to reset the camera. After the tip is in focus, Press “SET” button next to “FOCUS ON TIP” to set the focus height on the tip in the Engage Panel Engage Panel After the focus is set, move the laser with the arrows that surround a red target, such that you maximize “Sum” found in the “Sum and Deflection Panel”. Sum and Deflection Panel Within the Sum and Deflection Meter Panel, navigate to the “Detector” tab and select “Zero PD”. This should cause the red dot to move to the center of the cross hair. Next, move the optical focus down to get the sample in focus Again, its helpful to adjust the brightness and exposure. I increased the both the brightness and exposure by increments of 5. NOTE: a good way to determine if you are looking at the sample is to use the arrows that surround the video window and check to see if the features in the background move. Another good way to determine if you are near the surface is to see if the outter circle of the optical microscope is in focus, if it has sharp edges, then you are close to the surface, if it is not sharp then you are not near the surface. 6.5.4 Tuning the Cantilever Make sure the camera is focused on the tip Locate the the master panel, shown in the image below. Master Panel Click the “thermal” button in the blue side bar. Click “get real” and then click on the probe tip that you are using. A window shown in the image below should appear Select getreal\\(^{TM}\\) calibration in the right side bar of the new thermal window Thermal Graph Select the correct tip and press GetReal Calibration. At the top of the frequency sweep window, record the ampInvOls [nm/V] and spring constant [nN/nm] values in your lab notebook. Select the “Tune” button in the master panel, the following window should appear. Tune Window In the Cantilever Tune window, click the “Adv” button in the blue side bar and change Piezo to BlueDrive (if wanting to use blue drive). In the Cantilever Tune window, click on “Params” in the blue side bar and under “Auto Tune” change the “Target Percent” to -5. Click “Auto Tune” in the Cantilever Tune window. Record the values on cantilever tune graph (drive frequency [KHz], sweep width [KHz], drive amplitude [mW], tune q). Determine your sample rate using eqn. \\[ Sample Rate = \\frac{Drive Frequency}{Tune Q} \\] 6.5.5 Setting Scan Parameters Inside the imaging window, (AC mode), select the desired set point. The value of the set point should be set to 80% of the target amplitude Input the desired Scan size in \\(\\mu m\\), points and lines, and the scan rate Do not do scans of size 20\\(\\mu m\\) by 20\\(\\mu m\\). If there are any high peaks the tip could get damaged due to colliding with the peak. Input base name, note, and mode under save options. The name should follow the convention: Date_Project_Initials_Tool_Sample_RunInfo.csv The Igor software has restrictions on naming files so the name outlined in the step above cannot be set in the software. Naming Restrictions A naming convention that I’ve found to work is AppendedSampleName_SampleInfo_.

A python script was written to fix the name in post, contact Ryan Mizukami for the script. The note is unique to each picture. Go to the “Programming Tab” at the top of the window and select “filter panel” in order to see the sampling rate of the Cypher. filter panel Compare the calculated sample to the sample rate displayed in the filter panel. 6.5.6 Beginning the Scans You can capture an optical image of the sample’s surface by using controls in the “Video Window” Focus the optical microscope on the sample’s surface adjust the brightness and exposure such that the sample’s surface looks “good”. locate the “Capture” button at the top of the window. Video Window Press the “Capture” button to save a .tiff image of the video window. The captured image will increase the counter of the image. In the “Engage Panel” Click “Move to pre-engage”. Check the optical microscope window to see if both the sample and tip are still in focus by clicking on “focus on tip” and “focus on sample”. If the sample is out of focus: Refocus the optical microscope on the sample and press “Set” next to “focus on sample” If the tip is out of focus: Refocus the optical microscope on the tip and press “Set” next to “focus on tip” If either the tip or the sample were out of focus: Perform the “Tuning the Cantilever” Section again before continuing with the tip approach. Click “Begin tip approach”. The Z Voltage monitor in the Sum and Deflection Panel should oscillate from positive to negative as the tip approaches the set point. Once the tip has finished its approach, click “engage” within the Sum and Deflection Panel. The set point should be reached To check if the tip is engaged to the surface, use the hamster wheel to check if slightly changing the setpoint will change the z voltage. If the z voltage does not change as the setpoint is lowered slightly then the tip is likely to be engaged. If the Z Voltage is not stuck then you will need to withdrawal, change the set point and then start the tip approach again. Once the Z voltage is stuck you can move on to the next step. Select “Frame Up” within the master panel. Adjust the parameters so that 6.5.7 Things to Mention About Taking Scans/ Tips. Avoid phase hopping When the phase oscillates between lower than 90° to greater than 90°. This process can be read more on in Dr. Gredigs textbook about AFM found at /PHYS 545 - Advanced Experimental Methods in Materials Science - Thomas Gredig Look at log on gwiki to see if issue has be seen before. Log ALL issues that are seen when taking scans, if it is a repeated problem then a technician can be contacted. Take screen shots or record the anomalous behavior and inform Dr. Gredig. Contact Dr. Gredig or a trained user when running into unknown issues. Asylum Research AFM Customer Support number: 1-805-696-6466 The ampInvOls can be used by taking an initial scan to get a good estimate of the z range. This can be obtained by accessing the AFMDATA folder, located on the desktop, and dragging an image into the ARC 2 Controller Software. An image will appear with the range displayed in the upper left corner. igor image The follwing formula can be used to calculate the target amplitude. \\[ A_{Target} = r * AIO \\] where r is the z range, and AIO is the AmpInvOls that was recorded during the thermal frequency sweep step. Once the new target amplitude is obtained, move the tip to pre-engage, input the new target amplitude in the tune parameters window. Ensure to reset the set point to 80% of the new target amplitude re-tune the cantilever and then begin the approach of the tip again. 6.6 Power off Procedure Select “Stop” in the master panel. Select (un)load the sample located in the Engage panel. Turn off the laser. Un-mount the sample. If the AFM will not be used for the next couple of days, Turn the AFM controller off. Lock, Deactivate, and power off the vibration isolation table. Put the computer to sleep. 6.7 If the Tip Needs to be Replaced Inside of the Cypher accessories box, obtain the changing station, tweezers, and tips. Open door on AFM and remove magnetic shield. If there is a sample, remove the sample. Raise the black lever on the right side and pull out the stage. Use allen wrench, located on the right side of the stage, to unscrew tip-mount (1 small ccw turn). Remove piece, flip, and insert into changing station. Tighten the screw on the changing station to secure the chip. Press the button and remove the tip with tweezers. Insert new tip by pressing down the button and inserting the flat piece half way into the circle (make sure new tip is not damaged). Unscrew the screw on the changing station, take out the chip and put it into the AFM. Tighten the screw that we loosed first, make sure to put the allen wrench back inside of the AFM. Push the stage back into place and move the black lever down. Place magnetic shield and close AFM door. 6.8 Motors Not Initializing Error Some times the motors will fail to initialize. This can be caused by the motors or stage getting “stuck”. When this happens, turn off all pieces of the system (controller, computer, AFM) and let sit for at least 1 hour. If you return and the system will still not initialize, contact Dr. Gredig or a member of the Gredig Lab who is an authorized user of the system.

If the deposition chamber pressure reads “Over Range (Torr)”, the deposition chamber is not pressurized and is able to be opened. If deposition chamber pressure reads any value, depressurize the chamber by selecting the “System” chiclet, selecting the “Vacuum System” tab and starting the “Vent” process as shown below. Vent Deposition Chamber 8.2 Sample Preparation Open the chamber door and rotate the sample plate holder clockwise until it locks into place. Rotate the sample plate shutter out of the way. Gently lift and spin the sample plate clockwise until it is freed from the screws. Lower and remove the sample plate from the chamber. Sample Holder and Sample Plate Secure your sample substrates to the plate. Additional sample clips and screws can be found in the fume hood. Ensure all holes in the sample plate are filled with screws before returning it to the deposition chamber. Choose what type of source your material will be deposited from: radak (left) or resistive boat (right). Radak (left) and Resistive Boat (right) Sources The radak sources have both power and temperature control. For the radak sources: lift and remove the deposition source shutter. Turn the luxel baffle counterclockwise and lift up to remove. Insert the 50-75% full radak into the tungsten heating coil. CAUTION: The lip of the radak will poke out of the baffle opening as shown in the image below. Replace the baffle by lining up the prongs and turning counterclockwise until the prongs drop into the track. Turn the baffle clockwise to tighten and replace the source shutter. The resistive boat sources have only power control. For the resistive boat source, lift and remove the deposition source shutter. Loosen the wing nuts on each side and slide the resistive source under the side plates. Tighten the wingnuts to “finger-tight” so that the side plates are in contact with the resistive boat. CAUTION: The boats are prone to cracking from overtightening of the wingnuts. Radak in Baffle (left) and tungsten coil (right) Resistive Source in with Shutter (left) and without shutter (right) In the “Main” chiclet, navigate to the Load Materials tab. From the Side menu, select the source location where the deposition material has been placed and select the material from the drop-down menu.

Load Materials Tab 8.3 Material Deposition Turn on the chiller by pressing the “I/O” button on the front. The lights on the front panel will show if the water level is inadequate. Ensure that the pressure gauge on the front is below 60psi and the temperature is below 25C prior to starting the pump down sequence. Chiller Open the seal/vent compressed gas cylinder to 20psi output pressure. Open the pneumatic compressed gas cylinder to 80psi output pressure. Check the roughing pump oil level is within the red bubble on the back panel. If any variables in addition to the deposition rate, source temperature, power output, and % Rate deviation need to be live monitored, click to the “Data” chiclet, and open the “Real Time Data Viewer” tab on the left. Select and start data collection by selecting variables in the drop-down menu on the right. If there is not a “Pump Down” step in the loaded recipe, go to the “System” chiclet, select the “Vacuum System” tab and start the Pump Down process. When the system is below the minimum required pressure for a deposition, the exterior light will turn green. System Pump Down Once the Pump down process is completed, return to the Process tab in the “Main” chiclet and load the desired recipe. It will populate the recipe steps into the left bar under “Components”. Start the recipe by clicking the green “Play” button in the top right corner. During the deposition process, the deposition rate, source temperature, power output, and % Rate deviation are shown in the real time data viewer panel within Process tab in the “Main” chiclet. Deposition recipe variables can be changed during the process by selecting the recipe step in the left menu, entering the new variable value in the bottom window, and clicking “Update.” The variable values on the left should update to the entered value. This will not save the new values in the recipe file. If an error arises during the deposition process, the recipe can be stopped by clicking the red “Stop” button on the top right of the Process tab in the “Main” chiclet. If the system may be damaged by a step in the recipe, the emergency stop button on the right front of the evaporator can be used to cut power to all the system components. Recipe Selection Once the recipe is completed, navigate to the “System” chiclet, and select the Sources tab. The temperature of all sources in the system will be displayed. The evaporator system will not return to atmospheric pressure in the “Vent” process until all deposition sources are below 50C and the substrate heater is below 100C. 8.4 Sample Removal Open the “System” chiclet, and select the Vacuum System tab. Click “Vent” and start the venting process. Once the process has the step “Venting Chamber” highlighted and the deposition chamber pressure reads “Over Range (Torr)”, the chamber door can be opened. The exterior light will be blue. Turn the sample plate holder clockwise until it locks in place. Rotate the sample plate shutter away from the sample plate. Lift up and turn the sample plate clockwise to release it from the screws. Remove the sample plate from the chamber and take out the deposited samples. Replace all the screws in the holes in the sample plate prior to returning it to the deposition chamber. Lift up and remove the source shutter. For radak sources, turn the baffle counterclockwise and lift to remove. Remove and cover the radak and return to the appropriate desiccator. Replace the baffle lining up the prongs and turning counterclockwise until the prongs drop into the track. Turn the baffle clockwise to tighten and replace the source shutter. For resistive boat sources, loosen the wing nuts on each side of the source. Slide the resistive boat out of the holders. Cover and remove the boat and return it to the appropriate desiccator. Replace the source shutter. Close the deposition chamber door. If the system is to be used for another deposition within 24 hours, go to the “Vacuum System” tab in “System” chiclet, and start the Pump Down process. Return to Step 4 in System Start-Up upon starting the next deposition. If the system is not going to be used in the next 24 hours, close both the pneumatic and seal/vent compressed gas cylinders. Turn off the chiller by pressing the “I/O” button on the front panel. 8.5 Data Viewer in Aeres All data can be loaded post-deposition in the “Data Viewer” tab in the “Data” chiclet. Click “Load File” in the upper right and select the deposition file in the file explorer. Once the file loads, the “Filtered Parameters” can be chosen from the right menu and added to the graph by clicking “+” as shown in the image below. Data Viewer 8.6 Recipe Builder If there is not a preexisting recipe for your deposition, navigate to the “Recipe” chiclet and open the “Process Builder” tab. Click New if starting a recipe from scratch. Click Open if editing an existing recipe or using an existing recipe as reference. - Only one recipe can be opened at a time within the Process Builder tab. For recipes with a new material, it must first be added to the material database found in the “Materials” tab in the “Setup” chiclet. For the first deposition with a new material or a material in a new deposition source, an AutoTune step must be run prior to deposition to determine the PID parameters.
