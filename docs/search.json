It is hard to locate the photodiode light beam, once you lose\nThe photodiode beam can be seen in the software by looking at the cantilever. There will be a bright spot when the beam is on the cantilever. You can move the position of the beam by adjusting the dials on top of the z-stage. See image below.\n\n\nThe beam should be positioned near the tip of the cantilever. Adjust the position of the beam until the “Intensity (A+B)” reading is maximized (approx. 3 V)\n\n\nThe detector position is visualized in the software as a crosshair with a red/green dot with readings of the vertical/lateral position of the detector. It needs to be aligned so the dot in the crosshair is green. Adjust the position of the detector by adjusting the dials on the front of the z-stage. See image below.\n\nBy turning the dials on the front of the z-stage the dot on the crosshair will move left/right and up/down. Adjust the position of the detector until the “Vertical (A-B)” and “Lateral (C-D)” readings are minimized (less than 0.100 V is ideal)\n\n\n\n\nPhotodiode and Detector Adjustments\n\n\nIn the “Smart Scan” software click on the “Auto” tab in the top-right. Make sure that the green light for the centered diode beam is ON, then select the “Position” icon on the left-side of the screen. (If the LED is red, you need to align the photodiode beam first.) This will begin the process of measuring the cantilever’s resonant frequency. The resonance frequency and Q-factor must be recorded in the logbook.\n\nThe AFM will then begin to approach the sample so the tip is engaged with the surface of the sample. Wait for this process to complete before proceeding. (It may take a minute or so.)\n\nOnce the auto-engage process is finished, adjust the focus of the objective so it is focused on the sample’s surface. The cantilever should be close to the surface now.\nClose and lock the door so noise vibrations do not interfere with imaging.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsure Non-Contact Mode NCM is set for the scan. This is done by selecting NCM from the Head mode list next to the “Setup” tab in the SmartScan software. See image below.\n\n\n\n\nNon contact mode imaging\n\n\nWARNING: If you need to move to a different area of your sample for a scan see the “Lift Procedure” section for instructions. Attempting to move the sample without following the lift procedure will break the cantilever.\n\nYou can capture an image by selecting the “Image” icon on the left-side of the screen.\nAdjust the parameters for your scan as needed and determine an appropriate location for files to be saved once the scan is complete.\nOnce the scan is complete, you can redefine a new area by adjusting the scan window in the application or defining new scan area parameters.\n\nNOTE: Your scan area should be a power of 2 and must be square.\nEx: 128 x 128, 256 x 256, 512 x 512, etc.\nScan areas “snap” to a grid defined by the software when moving them. You can make fine adjustments to the scan area window by using the “Offset” parameter.\n\nYou can use Park XEI software to analyze your images on Windows systems. Gwyddion can be used for Mac OS systems.\n\n\n\n\nTo move to a different area of your sample you need to “lift” the tip away from the surface sufficiently far enough above the surface so the cantilever easily clears the height of all features on your sample.\n\nDefining the distance the tip should be raised and clicking the “Lift” button will disengage the tip from the sample’s surface. Lifting in intervals of 50 um is typically fine.\n\nCAUTION: The objective is very close to the z-stage during scanning. Using a large value for the lift may cause the z-stage to crash into the objective lens, damaging it. A lift of 100 um is usually fine but make sure you are aware of your sample’s expected feature height to determine an appropriate lift height above the surface. If there is any doubt, it is best to first move the objective up by unlocking the focus wheel and turning it clockwise (away from you) to prevent the z-stage from crashing into the objective. Refocus on the sample once the lift is complete.\n\nMoving the sample can be done by adjusting the dials on the sample stage. They will move the stage forward/back and left/right. See image below.\n\n\n\n\nAFM controller\n\n\n\nAfter repositioning your sample, click on the “Auto” tab and select the “Position” icon to re-engage the tip to the sample’s surface. This will perform a new scan of the cantilever to determine the resonant frequency and intensity which should be recorded in the logbook.\nScanning can be performed following instructions in the “Imaging the Sample” section above.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlock the objective (push lever back), then move the objective to the top position and lock back (pull forward).\nPerform a lift from the surface to disengage the tip. Typically a lift of 100 um is sufficient to clear all features.\nClick the “End” icon on the left-side of the screen to automatically raise the z-stage away from the sample. A manual lift can be performed but it is best to select the “Lift z all” option to provide the largest clearance between the z-stage and sample, allowing for easier loading/unloading of samples.\nRemove the sample holder from the sample stage by sliding it horizontally across the surface until it is no longer held by the magnet.\nReturn the Activation Table to the “Lock” state by pressing the button on the front left-side of the table, wait until it is locked, will take about 30 seconds, ONLY THEN turn it off by pressing the button on the front right-side. If the setup is used again, the next day, the activation table can be left on in the locked position.\n\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Turn OFF the photodiode.\nEnsure the objective is in its highest position.\nEnsure all LEDs are off, ONLY THEN disconnect the cable on the left-side of the z-stage and move the paddles securing it to the instrument to the “in” position. The paddles are located at the top of the z-stage mounting rails. See image below.\n\n\n\n\nAFM controller\n\n\n\nThe z-stage is heavy. Carefully slide the z-stage to the right, avoiding the objective, until it is off the mounting rails. See image above.\nPlace it in the stand as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n\nAFM controller\n\n\n\nThe cantilever can be removed by carefully lifting it up off of the two pins holding it in place. Place the removed cantilever in the appropriate slot of the replacements case.\nRemove a new cantilever from the case, record the new cantilever’s ID in the log book, and attach it to the z-stage by aligning the pins to the cantilever’s slots. You will need to carefully attach it onto the z-stage until it softly clicks into place. See images below.\n\n\nCAUTION: The cantilever is extremely delicate. Avoid getting the tip to touch any surface or anything.\n\n\n\n\nAFM controller\n\n\n\nSlide the z-stage back into its place on the instrument, careful to avoid hitting the objective.\n\n\nSlide it all the way to the left, until it cannot be moved anymore.\n\n\nLock the z-stage in place by moving the paddles to the “out” position.\nConnect the cable to the left side of the z-stage.\nFocus on the cantilever tip and adjust laser according to previous section."

Open the vales on both tanks and confirm that the tanks are not empty. The regulated pressure on each tank should read between 10 psi.\nMake sure that the vacuum pump is properly attached to the sputter system unit and turned on.\nPut on gloves before touching anything inside the sputter deposition chamber.\nOpen the top of the EMS575X unit and ensure that the appropriate targets are mounted. If not, unscrew the four screws holding the target mount and insert the desired target, taking note of which position it is in (the left side is target A, the right side is target B). When changing or moving targets, label which target is in which position on the paper mounted on the wall above the unit. Targets are stored in the drawer labeled Sputter Coater Components, directly beneath the sputter unit. For more information regarding target insertion/removal, see the EMS575X instruction manual.\nConfirm that the sample plate is covered with Al foil.

Carefully adjust this valve during the deposition until the plasma (the purple glow inside the chamber) reaches the greatest intensity. This will improve the deposition rate.\nThe deposition occurs in coating sequences of 5 minutes each (to prevent overheating).\nAfter the desired thickness has been reached, the system will end the sequence and the chamber will be vented.\nWhen the screen indicates that the venting process has terminated, open the top of the system and remove the samples.

When the system is below the minimum required pressure for a deposition, the exterior light will turn green.\n\n\n\n\nSystem Pump Down\n\n\n\nOnce the Pump down process is completed, return to the Process tab in the “Main” chiclet and load the desired recipe. It will populate the recipe steps into the left bar under “Components”. Start the recipe by clicking the green “Play” button in the top right corner.\n\nDuring the deposition process, the deposition rate, source temperature, power output, and % Rate deviation are shown in the real time data viewer panel within Process tab in the “Main” chiclet.\nDeposition recipe variables can be changed during the process by selecting the recipe step in the left menu, entering the new variable value in the bottom window, and clicking “Update.” The variable values on the left should update to the entered value. This will not save the new values in the recipe file.\nIf an error arises during the deposition process, the recipe can be stopped by clicking the red “Stop” button on the top right of the Process tab in the “Main” chiclet. If the system may be damaged by a step in the recipe, the emergency stop button on the right front of the evaporator can be used to cut power to all the system components.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipe Selection\n\n\n\nOnce the recipe is completed, navigate to the “System” chiclet, and select the Sources tab. The temperature of all sources in the system will be displayed. The evaporator system will not return to atmospheric pressure in the “Vent” process until all deposition sources are below 50C and the substrate heater is below 100C."

Lift up and turn the sample plate clockwise to release it from the screws. Remove the sample plate from the chamber and take out the deposited samples. Replace all the screws in the holes in the sample plate prior to returning it to the deposition chamber.\nLift up and remove the source shutter.\n\nFor radak sources, turn the baffle counterclockwise and lift to remove. Remove and cover the radak and return to the appropriate desiccator. Replace the baffle lining up the prongs and turning counterclockwise until the prongs drop into the track. Turn the baffle clockwise to tighten and replace the source shutter.\nFor resistive boat sources, loosen the wing nuts on each side of the source. Slide the resistive boat out of the holders. Cover and remove the boat and return it to the appropriate desiccator. Replace the source shutter.\n\nClose the deposition chamber door.\n\nIf the system is to be used for another deposition within 24 hours, go to the “Vacuum System” tab in “System” chiclet, and start the Pump Down process. Return to Step 4 in System Start-Up upon starting the next deposition.\nIf the system is not going to be used in the next 24 hours, close both the pneumatic and seal/vent compressed gas cylinders. Turn off the chiller by pressing the “I/O” button on the front panel."
