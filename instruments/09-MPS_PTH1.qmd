# Standard Operating Procedure for MPS-PTH

## Purpose

This SOP outlines the steps of using MPS-PTH for measuring resistance.

## Warnings and Precautions

- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment such as gloves.
- Ensure the equipment is properly grounded to prevent electrostatic discharge.
- Handle sensitive components with tweezers carefully to avoid damage.
- Turn off all power sources before performing maintenance or after experiments to avoid electrical hazards.

## Equipment and Materials

- Keithley 2400, MPS-PTH, Temperature controller, RS-232, Computer

## Procedure

### Preparation

1. Turn on the computer and all the instruments (Keithley2400, MPS_PTH, Temperature controller, PC).
2. Verify all connections as shown in the pictures below.

1. If one of those or both is "OFF," check the physical connection again and click on the picture of the disconnected device.
2. Click on "Refresh, select the right port, and click on "Connect."

1. Go back to the instrument connection condition and verify whether the device connection is "ON."
2. If "OFF," click on "OFF" and change it to "ON."

### Sample Handling

1. Wear gloves to prevent contamination and prepare the sample stage.
2. Open the cover of MPS-PTH.
3. Carefully retract the probe tips from the sample stage to ensure they are clear of the surface.
4. Carefully place the sample on the stage using tweezers.
5. Adjust probe tips or other components as needed for measurement.

### Measurement(resistance)

1. Open the software and Check that the temperature controller and Keithley2400 are connected well with PC.
2. Go to “Recipe” and set the desired parameters (e.g., target temperature, time, Ramping rate).
3. Because sample is usually sensitive, set for Ramping Rate from 1 to 5.

1. Initiate the measurement process.
2. Monitor the process and adjust settings if necessary.

### Post-Measurement

1. Loosen the nut and open the cover again.
2. Safely remove the sample from the stage using tweezers.
3. Cover the top.
